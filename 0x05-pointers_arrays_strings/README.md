## 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any var.

`Pointer Declaration`

```
int  *ip;        /* pointer variable declaration */
ip = &var;  /* store address of var in pointer variable*/

```
